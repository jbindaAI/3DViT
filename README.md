# Moving toward 3D Vision Transformers


## Overview
This repository contains code needed to train 3DViT models and compare them with 2D baselines.


### Prerequisites:
Firstly, you need to download LIDC-IDRI dataset and preprocess data as in: [Integration of Radiomics and Tumor Biomarkers in Interpretable Machine Learning Models](https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15092459).
I have preprocessed data in batches with `dataset_creation.py` script.
When you have data prepared, you need to create python3 virtual environment and install in it packages from a `requirements.txt`.
